---- 1.Top 10 revenue generating products

WITH product_revenue AS ( 
		SELECT s.product_id, 
	  		   p.product_name, 
	   		   ROUND(SUM(s.revenue)) as revenue_generated,
			   DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(s.revenue) DESC) AS revenue_rank

	   revenue_rank
FROM product_revenue
WHERE revenue_rank <= 10;

/* Insights : - Variants like White Chocolate 80% and Milk Chocolate 50% are leading in revenue with ~$250,000.
			  - Two SKUs account for roughly 2% of catalog yet generate outsized revenue — this concentration creates supply chain risk. 
			    If either product faces a stockout, the business has no immediate revenue substitute. 
				Recommendation : develop 2–3 backup SKUs in the White and Milk category to reduce dependency.
			  - Products labeled with higher cocoa percentages (80%, 90%) appear multiple times in the top 10.
			  - Dark Chocolate 60% is present but not among the highest earners.

---- 2.Bottom 10 products by revenue

WITH low_revenue_products AS ( 
		SELECT s.product_id, 
	  		   p.product_name, 
	   		   ROUND(SUM(s.revenue)) as revenue_generated,
			   DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(s.revenue) ASC) AS revenue_rank

)
SELECT product_id, 
	   product_name,
	   revenue_generated,
	   revenue_rank
FROM low_revenue_products
WHERE revenue_rank <= 10;

/* Insights : - All bottom 10 products are generating around the same revenue (~120k–125k).
			  - Low variance in revenue suggests these products have similar demand levels and may not be strong differentiators.
			  - Multiple Praline variants (70%, 80%, 90%) appear here.
			  - Even 90% cocoa products (Praline, Dark, Milk) are underperforming here.
*/

---- 3.Category-wise revenue

SELECT p.category, ROUND(SUM(s.revenue)) AS revenue
FROM sales s
JOIN product_dim p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

/* Insights : - With ~$6.5M in revenue, Praline outperforms all other categories.
			  - Praline leads revenue contribution, suggesting strong customer preference and potential for further product expansion in this segment
              - White (~$6M) and Dark (~$5.5M) are close behind Praline.
			  - Truffle (~$4M) and Milk (~$3.5M) generate much less revenue compared to the top three.
*/

---- 4.Products never sold

SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM product_dim p
LEFT JOIN sales s
ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.product_id IS NULL;

-- Insights : - All products have recorded at least one sale, indicating a well-performing catalog with no completely inactive SKUs.


-- ===========================
-- Customer Analysis
-- ===========================

-- 1. Top customers by revenue

SELECT customer_id, SUM(revenue) AS total_spending
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spending DESC
LIMIT 10;

/* Insights : - All top 10 customers spend between ~₹1,095 and ₹1,183.
              - Because their spending is similar, we can treat them as a distinct segment for personalized marketing.
*/


-- 2. Repeat vs new customers

WITH cust_type AS ( SELECT customer_id,
	   					   CASE
	   							WHEN COUNT(customer_id) <= 1 THEN 'new'
								ELSE 'repeat'
	   					   END AS customer_type
					FROM sales
				    GROUP BY customer_id 
)
SELECT 
    customer_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 
        1
    ) AS percentage
FROM cust_type
GROUP BY customer_type;

-- Insights : - The dataset shows no one-time buyers, which may indicate either strong retention or limited observation window.


-- 3. Customer lifetime value (CLV)

WITH customer_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        AVG(revenue) AS avg_order_value,
        COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders,
        MIN(order_date) AS first_purchase,
        MAX(order_date) AS last_purchase
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
),

customer_lifespan AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        GREATEST( EXTRACT(DAY FROM AGE(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date))) / 365,0.5 ) AS lifespan_years
		-- minimum 6-month floor to avoid division by near-zero
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT 
    cm.customer_id,
    ROUND(cm.avg_order_value * cm.total_orders / cl.lifespan_years, 2) AS clv
FROM customer_metrics cm
JOIN customer_lifespan cl 
    ON cm.customer_id = cl.customer_id
ORDER BY clv DESC;

-- Insights : - High CLV customers represent the most valuable segment and should be targeted for retention and upselling strategies.


-- 4. Customers who haven’t ordered recently (3 months)

SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) AS last_ordered
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING MAX(order_date) < DATE '2025-01-01' - INTERVAL '3 months';   -- chose '2025-01-01' instead of CURRENT_DATE as data is from 2023-2024

-- Insights : - Customers inactive for over 3 months may be at risk of churn and can be targeted with re-engagement campaigns


-- 5. Revenue by gender and loyalty membership

SELECT c.gender,
       c.loyalty_m,
       ROUND(SUM(s.revenue)) AS revenue,
       COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS customers
FROM sales s
JOIN customer_dim c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.gender, c.loyalty_m
ORDER BY revenue DESC;


-- 6. Age group segmentation

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN c.age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18–25'
        WHEN c.age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26–35'
        WHEN c.age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36–50'
        ELSE '50+'
    END AS age_group,
    ROUND(SUM(s.revenue)) AS revenue,
    ROUND(AVG(s.revenue), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM sales s
JOIN customer_dim c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY revenue DESC;



-- ===========================
-- Time series analysis
-- ===========================

-- 1. Monthly revenue trend

SELECT DATE(DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)) AS order_date,
	   ROUND(SUM(revenue),1) AS month_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date ASC;

/*Insight : The monthly revenue trend between Jan 2023 and Dec 2024 shows consistent seasonality, 
            with revenues averaging around $1M but spiking during key retail months.
			Notable peaks in mid-2023 and mid-2024 suggest strong performance during festival or 
			promotional periods, while troughs highlight post-season slowdowns. 
			Overall, the trajectory indicates steady growth, implying that Amazon-style sales 
			strategies are effectively capturing demand during high-traffic months. */


-- 2. Weekday vs weekend sales

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(DOW FROM order_date) IN (0,6) THEN 'Weekend'
    ELSE 'Weekday'
  END AS day_type,
  ROUND(SUM(revenue), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY day_type;


-- Insights : - Weekdays contribute significantly higher revenue than weekends, suggesting that purchasing activity is more concentrated during working days, possibly driven by routine buying behavior or business-related demand.
			  

-- 3. Running revenue

SELECT order_month,
	   month_revenue,
	   SUM(month_revenue) OVER(ORDER BY order_month) AS running_total
FROM ( SELECT 
			 DATE(DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)) AS order_month,
	   		 ROUND(SUM(revenue)) AS month_revenue
	   FROM sales
	   GROUP BY order_month
) t;

/* Insights : - Each month’s revenue is fairly stable, hovering around $1–1.1M. This indicates predictable sales performance without extreme spikes or dips.
			  - The running total steadily climbs, crossing $22M by Sep 2024. This confirms consistent revenue accumulation without interruptions.
			  - Since monthly revenue is stable, the running total grows almost linearly. This makes forecasting future totals easier.
			  - A steadily rising running total indicates no churn in overall revenue — customers keep buying, and sales are sustained.*/



-- ===========================
-- Store level analysis
-- ===========================

-- 1. Revenue by store type and country

SELECT st.store_type,
       st.country,
       ROUND(SUM(s.revenue)) AS revenue,
       COUNT(DISTINCT s.order_id) AS orders,
       ROUND(AVG(s.revenue), 2) AS aov
FROM sales s
JOIN store_dim st ON s.store_id = st.store_id
GROUP BY st.store_type, st.country
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

/* Insights : - Airport stores punch above their weight. Airport (UK) and Airport (Germany) are the top 2 revenue-generating combinations in the entire dataset.
			    This channel deserves prioritized stocking and premium product placement.
			  - AOV is suspiciously uniform across all store types and countries (~$25.3–$25.6).
			  - Online underperforms relative to its potential. Online Canada ($1.78M) and Online USA ($1.54M) rank 3rd and 4th, but Online France, UK, and Australia trail 
			    significantly — sitting at roughly half the revenue of their Mall and Airport counterparts in the same countries. 
				This suggests either lower online penetration in those markets or a distribution/marketing gap worth investigating.
			  - Retail is the weakest channel across all countries. Every Retail entry sits in the bottom half of the table. 
			    Retail France ($1.02M), Retail USA ($1.02M), Retail Germany ($761K), and Retail Canada ($509K) are all outperformed by Mall and Airport equivalents in the same country.
			  - UK and Germany are the strongest markets overall. Airport UK ($2.27M) and Airport Germany ($2.04M) lead the entire dataset. 
			    Combined with Mall UK ($1.28M) and Retail Germany ($761K), both countries generate strong multi-channel revenue. 
				These are the markets to protect and grow first.*/
